- 👋 Hi, I’m @OskarFiedot
- 📚 I am an engineering graduate with a degree in Telecommunications and am currently continuing my studies with a master's degree in Computer Science.
- :cloud: I took my first steps in the IT industry as Cloud Software Development Intern at Intel Corporation.
- 🌱 I am mainly interested in cloud technologies, Linux operating systems, DevOps approaches, cyber security and programming in languages such as Python, Golang and C++. 
- ⚽ Apart from computer stuff, I'm also interested in Polish and American Hip-Hop, which I express by collecting analogue and vinyl records for many years. 
Since childhood, I've also loved playing soccer and skiing, 
which helps me keep a balance between being active and spending hours at the computer.
- 📫 The easiest way to find me and get in touch with me is through Linkedin or by e-mail.
