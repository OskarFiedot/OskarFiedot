- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @OskarFiedot
- ðŸ“š I am a current student at the Gdansk University of Technology, where I study Telecommunications and try to take my first steps in the IT industry.
- ðŸ‘€ I like programming mainly in C# and Python and in these technologies I'm currently trying to develop, mainly in terms of backend programming. 
Apart from that I am interested in cloud technologies, DevOps approach and cybersecurity. 
In connection with the direction of my studies my interests also include telecommunication and computer networks. 
- âš½ Apart from computer stuff, I'm also interested in Polish and American Hip-Hop, which I express by collecting analogue and vinyl records for many years. 
Since childhood, I've also loved playing soccer and skiing, 
which helps me keep a balance between being active and spending hours at the computer.
- ðŸŒ± Currently I'm trying to develop as much as possible in terms of backend programming in Python and C#, although I also enjoy writing scripts in Bash. 
During my studies I gain knowledge in the field of network technologies.
- ðŸ“« The easiest way to find me and get in touch with me is through Linkedin or by e-mail.
